# My personal website
Hi! I am using the Hyde Jekyll template to make my personal website.

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

Please visit the Hyde website to get all the information you need on using this template!
