I love teaching.
This includes lecturing an undergraduate class, mentoring a student, or teaching a local dance class.
While at the University of Virginia, I took many opportunities to improve my teaching.
My favorite experience was participating in a university wide teaching program called [Tomorrow's Professors Today](http://cte.virginia.edu/programs/tomorrows-professor-today/).
This program offered seminars on pedagogy and learning styles as well as introduced me to numerous educators at UVa and abroad.
I was also able to present a poster at the [American Society of Engineering Education's](https://www.asee.org/) annual meeting in 2014.

### Classroom Experience

In addition to being a guest lecturer in numerous classes (including human physiology, systems bioengineering, computational principles of biomechanical engineering and motion biomechanics),
I was awarded a scholarship to co-teach a class with Dr. Shayn Peirce-Cottler during my 4th year of graduate school.
Through this scholarship, I was given the opportunity to develop the syllabus, teach half the lectures, and create the exams for our sophomore level introduction to biomedical engineering.
This was a transformative experience for me. 
I received first hand experience with every facet of teaching while having an experienced mentor to lean on.

### Outreach

I had the privilege to participate in numerous outreach programs.
Every year, the BME department at UVa gives tours to local students (3rd - 6th grade). 
Each participating lab teaches the students about their research through a demonstration or hands on experiment.
We also answer questions about science and college in general. 
In the picture to the right, I demonstrated the basics of cell culturing before we collected cheek cells to look at under a microscope.


From 2014 to 2015 I volunteered as a mentor for kids K through 12.
This was a weekly commitment, where students could ask for homework help on any subject they were struggling with.
I enjoyed teaching these kids about science and I was eager to share stories about my career/life choices.

### Student Mentoring

I have mentored numerous outstanding undergraduates over the years. 
Below is a list of the students and the projects I assisted them with.
