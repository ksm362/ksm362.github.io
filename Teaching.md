I love teaching.
This includes lecturing an undergraduate class, mentoring a student, or teaching a local dance class.
While I was at the University of Virginia, I took many opportunities to improve my teaching.
My favorite experience was participating in an university wide teaching program called [Tomorrow's Professors Today](http://cte.virginia.edu/programs/tomorrows-professor-today/).
This program offered seminars on pedagogy and learning styles as well as introduced me to numerous educators at UVa and abroad.
I was also able to present a poster at the  [American Society of Engineering Education](https://www.asee.org/) 2014 annual meeting.

### Classroom Teaching Experience

In addition to being a guest lecturer in numerous classes (including human physiology, systems bioengineering, computational principles of biomechanical engineering and motion biomechanics),
I was awarded a scholarship to co-teach a class with Dr. Shayn Peirce-Cottler during my 4th year of graduate school.
Through this scholarship, I was given the opportunity to develop the syllabus, teach half the lectures, and create the exams for our sophomore level introduction to biomedical engineering.
This was a transformative experience for me. 
I received first hand experience with every fascet of teaching while having an experienced mentor to lean on.

### Outreach

In addition to teaching undergraduate and graduate classes, I have also have the privilage to participate in many outreach programs.
Every year, the BME department at UVa gives tours to local students (3rd - 6th grade). 
Each participating lab teaches the students about their research.
We also answer questions about college. 
In the picture to the right, I showed the students how cell culturing works.
We also isolated our cheek cells and looked at them under a miscroscope.


From 2014 to 2015 I volunteered as a mentor for kids K through 12.
This was a weekly commitment, where students could ask for homework help on any subject they were struggling with.
I enjoyed teaching these kids about science, and I was eager to share stories about my career/life choices.

### Student Mentoring

I have mentored numerous outstanding undergraduates over the years. 
Below is a list of the students and the projects I assisted them with.


- Katherine Crump - Modelling muscle atrophy during space flight
- Madeleine McDonald - Reproducibility in creating skeletal muscle constructs
- Catherine Henry - Non-uniform sarcomere lengths in the mouse diaphragm
- Chris Kegelman and Ruba Shalhoub - *In vivo* sarcomere imaging
- Bridget Ward - Microscale muscle analysis of healthy and dystrophic diaphragm
- Brennan Torstrick - Induction of murine spinotrapezius ischemia via cauterization
- Julie Kokinos - Diaphragm Modeling in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
- Ross Gordon - Immunogenic response to PCL-PEO nanoparticles
- Grace Stuntz - Creation of a novel aortic flow system
- Scott Schubert - Effects of combination drug treatment on smooth muscle cells
- Caryn Just - Evaluation of thin films vs electrospun mats for intraluminal use
