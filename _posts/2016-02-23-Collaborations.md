### Immune modulation and muscle derived EcSOD

I have had the fortunate opportunity to work with [Dr. Zhen Yan](http://faculty.virginia.edu/yanlab/), and his former post-doc [Dr. Jarrod Call](https://coe.uga.edu/directory/profiles/call), on an enhanced EcSOD (extracellular superoxide dismutase) mice model.
The Zhen group has shown that muscle derived EcSOD plays an important antioxidative role, working systemically to reduce cardiac cachexia and complications associated with chronic heart failure as well as improve survival during sepsis.
I have contributed to some of these works by looking at the vasculature and monocyte/macrophage dynamics.
Below is a video of monocytes in a venule from a dorsal skin fold window chamber experiment.
The bright cells in the blood vessel are GFP positive, and the GFP production is linked to Cx3CR1 (found mainly in monocytes).
From this video, I was able to quantify the number of rolling, adhered, and flowing monocytes from mice with and without enhanced EcSOD.
