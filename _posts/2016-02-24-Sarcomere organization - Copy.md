### Overview

Sarcomere length is a fundamental parameter of skeletal muscles.
It is often used to determine where on the length-tension curve a muscle is operating.
Additionally, muscle damage or diseases can cause a disruption in sarcomere organization and impair muscle function.
I have worked with numerous talented undergraduates on imaging and analyzing sarcomeres from various muscles and animals.
These efforts have focused largely on confocal microscopy and endoscopy.

### Diaphragm sarcomere organization

My largest study on sarcomere organization has been done in collaboration with Bridget Ward and Catherine Henry, undergraduate students at the University of Virginia.
Initially, we were motivated by sarcomere length variability in the diaphragm.
The diaphragm is a unique circular muscle, with radial muscle fibers connecting to central tendon.
We hypothesized that the regions of the diaphragm (ventral, midcostal, and dorsal) had varying sarcomere lengths.
In our initial studies, we found the sarcomere lengths of the diaphragm regions were different in healthy mice .
We were also able to find sarcomere differences between healthy and *mdx* mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Catherine has taken this study even further by including 1) multiple age groups and 2) expanding the muscle parameters measured to investigate fiber branching, amount of interstitial space,
muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and macrophage counts. We are looking to submit a manuscript on our work in the spring of 2016.

### *In vivo* sarcomere assessment

Recently, Dr. Silvia Blemker purchased a Zebrascope, a minimally invasive optical endoscope which images skeletal muscle sarcomeres through second-harmonic generation.
A small needle probe is inserted into the muscle and a small box attaches to the probe (see right) to control the excitation laser and subsequent light emissions.
In collaboration with Katie Pelland, a graduate student, as well as undergraduates Chris Kegelman and Ruba Shalhoub, 
we have repeatedly measured sarcomere length in rat tibialis anterior muscles over a 16 day period.
This initial experiment was used to both test the repeatability of sarcomere measurements and to confirm that repeated zebrascope use did not damage the muscle.
We also used confocal microscopy, as was done in the diaphragm study above, to compare endoscope values of sacomere length with confocal microscopy.
