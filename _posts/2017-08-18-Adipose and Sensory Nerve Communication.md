### Overview
<p><img src="/images/microfluidic_flowchart.png" width="700px"></p> 
In our bodies, adipose tissue is highly dynamic.
It is a well-known energy storage organ that also communicates to the entire body via secreted factors (adipokines).
White adipose tissue is innervated by both sensory and sympathetic nerves.
These nerves influence energy storage and utilization.
Several studies have suggested some adipokines can influence neurogenesis (nerve growth).
I believe locally secreted neuropeptides (from sensory neurons) can modulate adipokine production.
I am exploring this local communication system using microfluidic devices and traditional cell culturing.
Using the experimental method outlined in the picture above, I am investigating which factors contribute the most to nerve growth and synaptogenesis.
This work will also be expanded to look at altered physiological conditions (disease, exercise, obesity, etc).
