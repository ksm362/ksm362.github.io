### Overview

Organs constantly communicate to one another.
For instance, exercised muscles release signals that aid in reducing body fat and insulin resistance while improving cardiovascular function. 
These organs, in turn, secrete more systemically active signaling molecules.
In order to isolate and understand the relationship between the organs, I have started working with a microfluidic device in Dr. Jorge Ruas's lab.


### Adipocyte-driven peripheral nerve growth

I am using a microfluidic device (pictured above) in order to explore the influence of adipocytes on nerve growth.
In our bodies, adipose tissue is highly dynamic.
It is a well-known energy storage organ that also communicates to the entire body via secreted factors (adipokines).
White adipose tissue is innervated by both sensory and sympathetic nerves.
These nerves influence energy storage and utilization.
Several studies have suggested numerous adipokines influence neurogenesis (neurite growth).
Using the experimental method outlined above, I plan to investigate which factors contribute the mosth to nerve growth and synaptogenesis.
This work will also be expanded to look at altered physiological conditions (disease, exercise, obesity, etc)
