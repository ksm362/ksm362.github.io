### Overview

Organs communicate to one another in response to changes in metabolic demands.
For instance, exercised muscles release signals that aid in reducing body fat and insulin resistance while improving cardiovascular function. 
These organs, in turn, secrete more systemically active signaling molecules.
In order to isolate and understand the relationship between the organs, I have started working with a microfluidic device in Dr. Jorge Ruas's lab.


### <i>In vitro</i> assessment of muscle-driven inter-organ communication

The microfluidic device allows for unidirectional flow between two cell types.
In order to emulate exercise <i>In vitro</i>, I will modify the microfluidic platform so I can electric pulse stimulate (EPS) the muscle cells.
Then I will use EPS to assess how muscle stimulation enhances adipose function (browning, adipokine secretion).
Similarly I am also interested in muscle to liver adaptation, and will evaluate EPS driven hepatocyte adaptation (Gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, urea production).
