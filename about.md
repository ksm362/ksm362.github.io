Outside of my scientific interests, I pursue numerous hobbies.
I enjoy playing board games, cooking, gardening, hiking and many other outdoor activities.
The picture above is from a day hike in Utah. 
I went there for a short course on image based biomedical modeling and we were given a day off to hike a local mountain.


My largest hobby is swing dancing.
I have been dancing since 2010 and I love taking lessons, especially on lindy hop, charleston, balboa, or blues.
Additionally, I help with the running of Charlottesville's swing dance organization. 
We have dance classes and social dancing every week. I often teach the classes as well as DJ the dance.
I have also helped with organizing workshop weekends where we hire bands for the dances and instructors to teach lessons.
