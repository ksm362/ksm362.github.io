Outside of my scientific interests, I pursue numerous hobbies.
I enjoy playing board games, cooking, gardening, hiking and many other outdoor activities.
The picture above is from a day hike in Utah. 
I went there for a short course on image based biomedical modeling and we were given a day off to hike a local mountain.


My largest hobby is swing dancing.
I have been dancing since 2010 and I love taking lessons, especially on lindy hop, charleston, balboa, and blues.
Additionally, when I lived in Virginia I helped Charlottesville's swing dance organization. 
We had weekly dance classes and social dancing. 
I often taught the classes as well as DJ the dance.
I have also helped with organizing workshop weekends where we hire bands and instructors.
