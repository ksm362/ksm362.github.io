Outside of my scientific interests, I pursue numerous hobbies.
I enjoy playing board games, cooking, playing guitar, hiking and other outdoor activities.
The picture above is from a multiple day hike along the HÃ¶ga Kusten Trail with my wife. 

One of my largest hobby is dancing.
I have been dancing since 2010 and I love taking lessons, especially on lindy hop, charleston, balboa, and blues.
While living in Virginia I helped Charlottesville's swing dance organization. 
When I moved to Stockholm, I also got involved in the local dance scene. 
I often teach classes as well as DJ social dance.
